company-links-consumer is responsible for determining if company links need to be updated

## Development
Common commands used for development and running locally can be found in the Makefile, each make target has a 
description which can be listed by running `make help`

```text
Target               Description
------               -----------
all                  Calls methods required to build a locally runnable version, typically the build target
build                Pull down any dependencies and compile code into an executable if required
clean                Reset repo to pre-build state (i.e. a clean checkout state)
deps                 Install dependencies
docker/kafka         Run kafka and create topics within docker
docker/kafka-create-topics Create kafka topics within docker
docker/kafka-start   Run kafka within docker
docker/kafka-stop    Stop kafka within docker
package              Create a single versioned deployable package (i.e. jar, zip, tar, etc.). May be dependent on the build target being run before package
sonar                Run sonar scan
test                 Run all test-* targets (convenience method for developers)
test-integration     Run integration tests
test-unit            Run unit & integration tests (see 'Makefile Changes' section below for explanation)

```
## Running kafka locally
From root folder of this project run ```docker-compose up -d```

Once containers up, run ```docker-compose exec kafka bash``` to enter kafka bash to create topics

### Create kafka topics locally
kafka-topics.sh --create   --zookeeper zookeeper:2181   --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1   --topic main-topic

kafka-topics.sh --create   --zookeeper zookeeper:2181   --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1   --topic retry-topic

kafka-topics.sh --create   --zookeeper zookeeper:2181   --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1   --topic error-topic

### Create kafka topics locally
kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper zookeeper:2181

### Produce kafka test messages locally
kafka-console-producer.sh --topic delta-topic --broker-list localhost:9092

## Makefile Changes
The jacoco exec file that SonarQube uses on GitHub is incomplete and, therefore, produces incorrect test coverage
reporting when code is pushed up to the repo. This is because the `analyse-pull-request` job runs when we push code to an open PR and this job runs `make test-unit`.
Therefore, the jacoco exec reporting only covers unit test coverage, not integration test coverage.

To remedy this, in the
short-term, we have decided to change the `make test-unit` command in the Makefile to run `mvn clean verify -Dskip.unit.tests=false -Dskip.integration.tests=false` instead as this
will ensure unit AND integration tests are run and that coverage is added to the jacoco reporting and, therefore, produce accurate SonarQube reporting on GitHub.

## Terraform ECS

### What does this code do?

The code present in this repository is used to define and deploy a dockerised container in AWS ECS.
This is done by calling a [module](https://github.com/companieshouse/terraform-modules/tree/main/aws/ecs) from terraform-modules. Application specific attributes are injected and the service is then deployed using Terraform via the CICD platform 'Concourse'.


Application specific attributes | Value                                | Description
:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------
**ECS Cluster**        |data-sync                                      | ECS cluster (stack) the service belongs to
**Load balancer**      |N/A consumer service                                           | The load balancer that sits in front of the service
**Concourse pipeline**     |[Pipeline link](https://ci-platform.companieshouse.gov.uk/teams/team-development/pipelines/company-links-consumer) <br> [Pipeline code](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/ssplatform/team-development/company-links-consumer)                                  | Concourse pipeline link in shared services


### Contributing
- Please refer to the [ECS Development and Infrastructure Documentation](https://companieshouse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVOPS/pages/4390649858/Copy+of+ECS+Development+and+Infrastructure+Documentation+Updated) for detailed information on the infrastructure being deployed.

### Testing
- Ensure the terraform runner local plan executes without issues. For information on terraform runners please see the [Terraform Runner Quickstart guide](https://companieshouse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVOPS/pages/1694236886/Terraform+Runner+Quickstart).
- If you encounter any issues or have questions, reach out to the team on the **#platform** slack channel.

### Vault Configuration Updates
- Any secrets required for this service will be stored in Vault. For any updates to the Vault configuration, please consult with the **#platform** team and submit a workflow request.
